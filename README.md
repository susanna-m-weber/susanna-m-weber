### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Susanna, a physics and EECS student at UC Berkeley! I'm interested in the intersection of those two fields, from neural networks in medical imaging to electronic systems for rockets. You can find some of those things here:   

#### Research 
- **Deep Learning Methods for Medical Image Translation**  - Created and trained models based on [Cycle GAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) and [vision transformers](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer) to classify magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images by different anatomical and statistical features.

#### Rocketry 
- [**LE2 Test Stand Avionics System**](https://github.com/calstar/le2-avionics) - A system of multiple boards used by [UC Berkeley Space Technologies and Rocketry (STAR)](https://stars.berkeley.edu/) for sensing and actuation during hotfire of a liquid engine test system, LE2. 

#### Class Projects
- Maze Generating Video Game 
- [**Robotic Tabletop Football Goalie**](https://github.com/susanna-m-weber/106-final-proj) - A robotic arm controlled by an ESP32 that controls a foosball table goalie by using the [opencv-python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) library to detect and predict the motion of the ball. 
- [**SchrÃ¶dinger's Equation Visualization**](https://github.com/sijinwnag/group5-phys77) - Final project for a computational physics course, creating a series of animations representing the classic "particle in a box" problem from quantum mechanics in 2D and 3D.
