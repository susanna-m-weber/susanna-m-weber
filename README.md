### Hi there üëã

I'm Susanna; I'm a biomedical engineering PhD student at the Vilcek Institute at NYU Langone. I studied physics and electrical engineering at UC Berkeley, and I'm interested in the intersection of those three fields, from neural networks in medical imaging to electronic systems for rockets. You can find some of those things here:   

#### ‚öõÔ∏è Research 
- **Deep Learning Methods for Medical Image Translation**  - Created and trained models based on [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) and [vision transformers](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer) to classify magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images by different anatomical and statistical features.

#### üöÄ Rocketry 
- [**LE2 Test Stand Avionics System**](https://github.com/calstar/le2-avionics) - A system of multiple boards used by [UC Berkeley Space Technologies and Rocketry (STAR)](https://stars.berkeley.edu/) for sensing and actuation during hotfire of a liquid engine test system, LE2. 

#### üíª Class Projects 
- [**Cardiac Segmentation for MRI**](https://github.com/susanna-m-weber/cardiac_segmentation) - Using an Attention U-Net to segment the endocardium and epicardium in MR scans 
- [**Robotic Foosball Goalie**](https://github.com/susanna-m-weber/106-final-proj) - A robotics project using computer vision and an ESP32 microcontroller to track the ball and control the goalie in a game of tabletop soccer. 
- [**Maze Generating Video Game**](https://github.com/susanna-m-weber/maze_game) - A 2D video game where the player navigates a randomly generated maze while being chased by a pursuing avatar that can end the game. Players can find power-ups to navigate the maze more easily, and win by collecting a key and making it to the maze exit.
- [**Schr√∂dinger's Equation Visualization**](https://github.com/sijinwnag/group5-phys77) - Final project for a computational physics course, creating a series of animations representing the classic "particle in a box" problem from quantum mechanics in 2D and 3D. 
- [**Noise-Cancelling Headphones**](https://github.com/snpal/noise_cancelling_headphones) - A demonstration of using Fourier transforms for active noise-cancelling, evaluating effectiveness at various pitches and for different levels of noise.

- [**Robotic Tabletop Football Goalie**](https://github.com/susanna-m-weber/106-final-proj) - A robotic arm controlled by an ESP32 that controls a foosball table goalie by using the [opencv-python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) library to detect and predict the motion of the ball.
